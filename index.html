            The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the ‘Devil’s Triangle’, is an area of the North Atlantic Ocean that is clouded with 
            mysterious stories of grave danger. Over the years, multiple reports of missing ships and planes have led to a 
            long-lasting suspicion that the area held some sort of otherworldly properties. The most bewildering part of these 
            missing cases is that the vehicle, and people, were never found. Some have tried to explain this enigma by attributing 
            these disastrous incidents to weather, wave patterns, or even the questionable existence of the lost city of ‘Atlantis’. 
            In contrast, experts now conclude that Bermuda’s large reef system, tropical storms, and hurricanes, were what really led 
            to the disappearances all this time. Before the 1950s, ships and planes had less sophisticated navigation systems and the 
            technology at the time was very underwhelming in terms of weather forecasting. So, it is highly possible these cases were 
            purely environmental, but some sense of mysticality still lingers due to the Triangle’s unexplainable magnetic field, where 
            compasses sometimes point to true north, rather than magnetic north. Today, the Bermuda Triangle is safe for ships and 
            planes to pass, and there have been no recent incidents pertaining to supernatural forces. The  US Navy, US Coast Guard, 
            US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ensure that the area is perfectly safe for travel.
